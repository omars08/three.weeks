WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans will speed their 
tax plan toward a possible floor vote this week, 
and liberal activists will ramp up their efforts 
to block the bill, in what promises to be a frenzied 
stretch of an already breakneck attempt to complete a 
tax overhaul by Christmas.

With several Republican senators not yet committed to 
supporting the $1.5 trillion tax plan, the week is 
expected to be punctuated by behind-the-scenes arm twisting 
and deal-making as Republican leaders work to find enough votes 
to pass the bill along party lines. At least a half-dozen senators have 
raised concerns about the bill, including its potential to add to the federal 
deficit and a provision that would eliminate the Affordable Care Act requirement 
that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty.

On Monday, several Republicans from the Senate Finance Committee, 
including its chairman, Orrin Hatch of Utah, will head to the White House 
to meet with President Trump for a 12:30 p.m. lunch to talk about taxes. 
And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump will head to Capitol Hill for a lunch with Republican lawmakers. 
Ahead of the meetings, Mr. Trump sent out a tweet Monday morning suggesting party leaders 
were close to making changes to win over some skeptical Senate Republicans, perhaps by 
increasing the bill’s benefits for certain groups, such as small business owners.
